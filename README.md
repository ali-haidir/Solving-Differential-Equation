# Solving-Differential-Equation
Consider the following differential equation with the given initial condition: dp/dt = 0.1 P P(t=0) = 100


1. Define a function in any programming language that, given a time stamp, returns
the value of the analytical solution for the above differential equation.
2. Define a function to solve the given differential equation using the Euler method.
The function should accept the time stamp to find the population at and the time
step size.
3. Define a function to find the error between the solutions of both analytical and
numerical methods.
4. The error should be determined for at least five different values of time steps.
5. Define a function that plots the error vs time step and comment on the
relationship between the error and time step.
